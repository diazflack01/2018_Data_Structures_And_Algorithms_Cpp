void InsertionSort::sort(unsigned arr[], const unsigned arrLen)
{
    // SOLUTION 1 - starts loop in index 0 and swaps whenever value to
    // insert is less than an element from the sorted sublist


    // SOLUTION 2 - starts loop in index 1 and swaps whenever value to
    // insert is less than an element from the sorted sublist


    // SOLUTION 3 - By Tutorials Point
    // saves the value to a local varable then continually move holeposition
    // when an element from sorted sublist is greater than value to insert
